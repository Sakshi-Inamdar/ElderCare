            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <br>
            <p>The old age is an integral part of human life. It is the evening of life. It is unavoidable, unwelcomed and problem ridden phase of life. It is interesting that everyone wants to live a long life but not to be old. It is ironical that however undesirable it is old age has to come. We are all compelled to face the pain and pleasures of life. Old age complete the life pattern. It has its own pleasures though different from the pleasures of youth.</p>
            <p>The old people have spent all of their lives for their families. They raised, support and made them able to live in the society. They gave them values, courage and motivation to face all hardships. So, when they get old and need moral and physical support, it is the family responsibility to stand beside them. Give them respect, love and care as they gave you when you are dependent on them.

            <p>For the people with age group 65+ it is really hard to walk properly but for buying medicines they have to go and do it by themselves which is really hard. So we can start to offer them medicines via their Phones. Just a single tap or call can help them to get the medicines on their doors.</p>
            <p>We can make a website where they can create their accounts and contact with the specialized doctors and order medicines which they want or the suggested by medic. They will have their health checkup reports and data in their phone.</p>
